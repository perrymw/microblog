# microblog
###FIRST FLASK PROJECT###
Following Miguel Grinberg's tutorial, this is a microblog where users can sign in and make a blog post.

v0.1 - This just diplays "Hello World" on a page.  Nothing too exciting for the Flask experts, but definitiely exciting for a novice.

v0.2 - no changes from 0.1; experimenting with tagging.

v0.2.1 - included data to be displayed on a page in a certain manner.

v0.3 - included a login page that accepts all users upon submissions

v0.4 - users are stored in a database and their posts as well
